# rock-paper-scissors

This is intended to be a rock, paper, scissors game that is to be performed using the command line (at the moment).
The computer is randomly given one of the three options, whereas the user will be prompted to make a selection.
A message will be displayed based on whether the player won, lost, or reached a draw. Knowledge in using javascript
by creating different variables and functions will be displayed with this little project.
